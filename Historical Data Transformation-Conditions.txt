Historical Data Transformation

Assumptions made by me during this project:
All date values are in a consistent format.
The input CSV file has no duplicate records.
Missing data in a record should be filled with the most recent past record's values.
Employee identifiers are unique and consistent.
Fields without associated dates (unchanged values) remain constant across different records.
